# The C Programming Language (K&R)

A repository for all the knowledge I achieved by reading "The C Programming Language" book written by [Brian Kernighan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Kernighan) and [Dennis Ritchie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie). Learn more about it on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language).
